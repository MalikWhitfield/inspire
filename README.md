# inspire

Inspire is a web-application designed as a Google Chrome home page. Users have a different background upon every page refresh, as well as a different motivational quote at the top of the screen. Underneath the quote is the current weather in their area. These images, quotes and weather are retrieved from different databases using axios and APIs. Built using JavaScript, HTML and CSS.
